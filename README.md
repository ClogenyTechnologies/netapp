netapp Cookbook
===============

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/ClogenyTechnologies/netapp.svg)][travis]

[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/ClogenyTechnologies/netapp

The netapp cookbook manages the Clustered Data ONTAP (CDOT) filers using the NetApp ZAPI. The actions are cluster-wide or Storage Virtual Machine (SVM, formerly known as Vservers) specific.

Requirements
------------
#### NetApp Manageability SDK Library v5.0
You can download it from [NetApp](http://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/software?product=NetApp+Manageability+SDK&platform=All+Platforms) after you have created an account on [NetApp NOW](https://support.netapp.com/eservice/public/now.do)

NetApp connection
-----------------
The ZAPI connection is made over HTTP or HTTPS, with a user account that exists on the NetApp storage cluster. The user is only granted HTTP login and API roles, meaning that the user has no permission to do anything outside of ZAPI. The root user account also works but NetApp does not recommend using it. The connection settings are managed by attributes in the cookbook but are also exposed in Common attributes for the NetApp Resources.

    ['netapp']['url'] = 'https://root:secret@pfiler01.example.com/vfiler01'

or

    ['netapp']['https'] boolean, default is 'true'.
    ['netapp']['user'] string
    ['netapp']['password'] string
    ['netapp']['fqdn'] string
    ['netapp']['virtual_filer'] string

NetApp Resources
================

Common Attributes
-----------------
In addition to those provided by Chef itself (`ignore_failure`, `retries`, `retry_delay`, etc.), the connection attribute(s) are exposed all NetApp Resources even though they are typically set by attributes.
